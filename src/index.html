        Hi, <a href="#about">Neil</a> here!

        <h4 id="design-systems">Design Systems</h4>
        <p>I have extensive experience building component design systems for SaaS frontends on the web. In both <a href="https://www.fieldaware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FieldAware</a> and <a href="https://www.valid8me.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">valid8me</a>, I have worked closely with the product owners and the UX leads to introduce a custom <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StorybookJS</a> component library to the frontend architecture using <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReactJS</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VueJS</a>, respectfully.</p>
        <p>
          In both cases, the rollout of the component library to our production applications resulted in ~80% fewer frontend bugs in new features and a 50% decrease in the development time for tickets.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my experience, there is no other single enhancement that a feature delivery team can make to their process that can impact the whole organistion. 
        </p>
        <h4 id="release-strategies">Release Strategies</h4>
        <p>
          Over the past 18 months, I've focused on making feature releases at valid8Me faster, safer, and simpler. Fewer bugs, less stress, near-zero rollbacks, and happier product owners are the metrics that have defined success for this effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Achieving these goals meant digging into every aspect of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/sdlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDLC</a>: from improving ticket structures and refining <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git workflows</a> to fine-tuning AWS permissions and setting up GitHub automations. Such wide-reaching challenges can feel overwhelming, but the payoff has been worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team, we've transformed "release hell" into "release heaven." Along the way, I picked up just enough DevOps know-how to make their team nervous when I open a PR. ðŸ˜‰

        <p>Is there anything more satisfying than spotting an unused nested object in a JSON payload and promptly removing it? Of course there isn't!</p>
        <p>I love tackling tough web performance challenges with my team. From optimizing network requests and perfecting <a href="https://web.dev/articles/fcp#what-is-fcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FCP</a>/<a href="https://web.dev/articles/lcp#what-is-lcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LCP</a> benchmarks to implementing <a href="https://web.dev/articles/code-splitting-suspense?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lazy loading</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/virtualize-long-lists-react-window?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtualization</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-debounce-example/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debouncing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20memoization%20or%20memoisation,the%20same%20inputs%20occur%20again." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memoization</a>, <a href="https://v3.vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#chunking-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code splitting</a>, and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tree shaking</a>â€”I'm all in on faster and lighter web UIs.</p>
        <p>Moreover, I take great pleasure in sharing learnings from these efforts among the team and guiding junior developers to take on the same challenges in our applications.</p>

        <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
        <p>I live and work in beautiful Cork City in Ireland, having previously spent a number of years in Dublin.</p>
        <p>My journey into IT took a non-traditional path, shaped by a diverse educational background. Along the way, I studied language, film, music, and multimediaâ€”skills I now apply in surprising and practical ways in the software industry!</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I spend a lot of my free time playing music and I categorise myself as a hardworking hobbyist! I recently took some time off to play guitar on a short tour in Germany.</p>

          <figcaption>That's me on the left. Wunderbar!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>For 2025, I'm focussing on expanding my influence in the development communityâ€”writing, contributing to open source, and connecting beyond my current network.</p>
